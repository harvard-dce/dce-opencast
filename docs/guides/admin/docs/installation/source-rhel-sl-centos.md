Install from Source (RedHat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific Linux, Fedora)
===============================================================================

Preparation
-----------

Create a dedicated Opencast user.

    useradd -d /opt/matterhorn opencast

Get Opencast source:

You can get the Opencast source code by either downloading a tarball of the source code or by cloning the Git
repository. The latter option is more flexible, it is easier to upgrade and in general preferred for developers. The
prior option, the tarball download, needs less tools and you do not have to download nearly as much as with Git.

Using the tarball:

Select the tarball for the version you want to install from
https://bitbucket.org/opencast-community/matterhorn/downloads#tag-downloads

    # Download desired tarball
    curl -O https://bitbucket.org/opencast-community/matterhorn/...
    tar xf develop.tar.gz
    mv opencast-community-matterhorn-* /opt/matterhorn/

Cloning the Git repository:

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/opencast-community/matterhorn.git
    cd matterhorn
    git tag   <-  List all available versions
    git checkout TAG   <-  Switch to desired version

Building Opencast
-------------------

Make sure everything belongs to the user `matterhorn`:

    sudo chown -R opencast:opencast /opt/matterhorn

Switch to user `opencast`:

    sudo su - opencast

Compile the source code:

    cd /opt/matterhorn
    mvn clean install -DdeployTo=/opt/matterhorn


Configure
---------

Please follow the steps of the Basic Configuration guide. It will help you to set your hostname, login information, â€¦


Running Opencast
------------------

Install Opencast start script and man-page for installations in `/opt`:

    cd /opt/matterhorn/docs/scripts/init/opt
    sudo ./install.sh

This will install the start script along with either a SysV-Init script or a
systemd unit file.

Now you can start Opencast by running

    sudo matterhorn --interactive

Browse to [http://localhost:8080] to get to the admin interface.


Run Opencast as Service
-------------------------

Usually, you do not want to run Opencast in interactive mode but as system service to make sure matterhorn is run only
once on a system and is started automatically.

SysV-Init:

    # Start Opencast
    sudo service matterhorn start
    # Autostart after reboot
    sudo chkconfig --level 345 matterhorn on

Systemd:

    # Start Opencast
    sudo systemctl start matterhorn
    # Autostart after reboot
    sudo systemctl enable matterhorn
